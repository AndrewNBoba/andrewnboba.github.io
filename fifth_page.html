<h1 style="color:OliveDrab; text-align:center">Walk in the Park</h1>

<p style="color:OliveDrab; font-size:150%; text-align:center">You wake to an idle forest with only the sound of stream water trickling. Still shivering, you notice smoke in the distance. Maybe it's made by the figure you have been following. Either way, a campfire would be nice to warm up against.</p>
